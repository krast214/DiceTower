# Silent Karaoke

Silent Karaoke is a hilarious party game for friends and family. Each round, one player gets a secret song or phrase and must act it out using only gestures and lip-syncingâ€”no sound allowed! The rest of the players try to guess as quickly as possible. The first to guess correctly wins the round. Rotate performers and keep score. Most points at the end wins!

## Features
- Joinable rooms and lobby
- Each round, a player is the "Performer" with a secret prompt
- Players guess the prompt in real time
- Modern, responsive UI

## Setup
This is a base implementation. Server and client logic should be added to support real-time multiplayer gameplay.
